In KODIAK we found an ACM that ib_acme reported wrong source gid.
The value didn't correspond any gid in subnet.

ACM gets source gid during prdb parsing and stores it as part of a
path record object in its cache.
We can't reproduce the problem any more. The patch allow to ensure that
in case of ibv_query_gid failure we don't store garbage in path record.
